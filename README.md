# Project 3

This project is an IOS team project for the Masters course **Application Development in IOS** at **UTS**.

We decided to do a basic IOS Swift application that helps users who may want to invest in or just learn about different cryptocurrencies view data about the latests prices of different coins, view market cap data and view relevant news articles.

The project was completed in a group of 4 students who have various levels of experience with git and ios development flow.
For this reason the project is limited in scope nevertheless a basic MVP is achieved.

**Install**

The project uses a cocoapods module, so in order to build on your machine please install this library.
  ```
  sudo gem install cocoapods
  ```
  
Then from the directory containing the pod file:
```
  pod install
```

Then open the xcode workspace file (instead of project file).

If there are any build dependency problems please check that the project sees all source files under 
Project-> Build Phases.
