# Project 3

This project is an IOS team project for the Masters course **Application Development in IOS** at **UTS**.

We decided to do a basic application that helps users who may want to invest in or just learn about different cryptocurrencies view data about the latests prices of different coins, including market cap data and relevant news articles.

The project was completed in a group of 4 students who have various levels of experience with git and ios development flow.
For this reason the project is limited in scope nevertheless a basic MVP is achieved.

**Install**

The project uses a cocoapods module, so in order to build on your machine please install this library.
  ```
  sudo gem install cocoapods
  ```
  
Then from the directory containing the pod file:
```
  pod install
```

If there are any build dependency problems please check that the project sees all source files under 
Project-> Build Phases.
